Individual-based model of closed predator-prey system following game theory dynamics with full mass conservation. 

Select trait 
-	Hawk (p)
-	Dove (1 ¬– p)

Abilities (dove)
-	Always share prey with another dove.

Abilities (hawk)
-	Always beat dove
-	If competing with a hawk, you incur a cost, C, and a 0.5 probability of gaining prey, G. 

Controls on the fast time scale 
-	searching, handling, or fighting.
